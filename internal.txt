Next
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- map revamp
	- Current QuadTree impl is slow and is rebuilt every frame(!) per force that uses it
		- can we hijack maybe a corner of the Unity 3d physics scene and just get trigger overlaps?
		- or do we need to import some wort of physics broadphase collision hander? (I like bullet, but don't want to deal with native)
		- nn can't use normal Unity physics, can't have seperate settings for our scene, and don't want to break any base game stuff
	- maybe adjust door align to act like a spring joint in a certain distance and angle


	- shader for lines, so they get gradient
	- shader for tiles, so they are z-buffer and normal opaque
	- need to use fancy smart "line" shaders for better performance?

	- maybe a list with the map of previewed items and their locations, most important first
		- maybe importance = number of times there's a logic condition that requires it

- Data
	- Missing items:
		- All Boss essence aren't pulled in (e.g. Gorb, Xero, Zote)
		- Lore_Tablet-World_Sense
		- sub-level grabs:
			- Nailmaster's_Glory
			- Colosseum rewards
			- Void Heart
			- Dreamers
	- Wrong location:
		- Geo_Rock-Ancestral_Mound or Geo_Rock-Ancestral_Mound_Dupe
		- Geo_Rock-Abyss_2

	- skip scenes
		- Cinematic_*, Dream_Final,

	- exported images have transparency from the in-game buffer, should be opaque
	- probably burn off all the black around the edges and just add back some border

- Live view
	- rename TangledMapManager -> LiveMarkerManager
	- add "waypoints" from logic

	- test with not all item types randomized

	- show shade
	- fix brief blip with thing in wrong place when changing scenes
	- don't re-roll random offset every update
	- compound icons (previewed AND readable/unreachable)
		- add an icon if previewed location has a progresson item of any sort?


	- maybe add stats/number on outgoing transitins about what's available there?

- Auto item preview?
	- auto-reveal geo/grub (or secret fake)/soul world items if oyu are close enough
		- set to previewed if in camera view frustum for 500ms
	- may need to seperate my "previews" from logic previews. e.g. grub vs. mimic. "geo rock", but is it 15 geo? 420 geo?


- docs
	- Live icons: "They help you determine if you need to learn something new, come back later, or git gud."
	- Remember:
		- green means you can get there from where you started the game, not necessarily from where you are standing right now.
		- red means logic doesn't expect you to, or can't prove that you can, reach it right now. In particular, simple key areas may be marked inaccessible until you have access to all keys.
	- for file in *.png; do convert $file -colorspace RGB -resize 50% -colorspace sRGB -quality 95 "`basename $file .png`.jpg"; done


- things:
	- show number of new checks accessible when you grab an item (that unlocks things)
		- "xxyy transitions/locations became available" when you get something
		- and bonus points if it shows a summarized list of areas you can reach now
	- show logic for a given check and which conditions are true
	- maybe distinguish between previewed junk and progression items
	- Spoilers: Off, Off (strict), Thematic, Truly Thematic, Casual, On
		- Strict disables auto-preview
		- Thematic reaveals information based on in-game informatoin items (e.g. area maps reveals corrosponding rooms and outgoing transitions between mapped rooms), grub map reveals grub locations
		- Truly Thematic only updates the map once you find the quill, reveals rooms from maps you find.
		- Casual allows buying hints
		- On just shows everything
	- Or have a "Maps are:" option: Useless, Useful, Critical
	- live view option
		- that's "memory only" - only indicates what you've done, what what you could/can't do
		- that only shows the markers when you're focusing soul - might be a good default
	- Maybe always sort items by name since some things will render on top of others.
	- Item names above previewed items?
	- pathfinding: see RCPathfinder

- need a tracker
	- grub and other currency count
		- include depositied rancid eggs
		- dream essence, even if we don't have the nail

	- dreamer count
	- keys


- Randomizer:
	- ItemChanger + benchwarp and no preload - try warp:
		NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
	  at ItemChanger.StartDef+<OnRespawn>d__38.MoveNext () [0x0021c] in C:\dev\ItemChanger\ItemChanger\StartDef.cs:167
	  at UnityEngine.SetupCoroutine.InvokeMoveNext (System.Collections.IEnumerator enumerator, System.IntPtr returnValueAddress) [0x00026] in <047294ce45cf4b9a9441e48d2b8435e4>:0
	- Geo_Rock-Mantis_Outskirts_Alcove, IMO, should require difficult skips when itemless, not just precise movement
	- Stag egg should be lore. :-)
	- Started in Crossroads_ShamanTemple, but items right next to start point marked unreachable
	- Charm_Notch-Shrumal_Ogres is super-attainable with just a down nail attack (may be obscure, though)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- map tiles
		- deal with black screen during bench wake up
		- thumbs don't get the LUT
		- can't see acid and sometimes other level details
		- some way to deal with the massive useless margins
			- automated GIMP filter?

		- maybe put a bunch of successive backplanes in so it looks like fog?


- Issues
	- Collected items don't appear right on new saves until you've saved and refreshed the page
	- more visible player room
	- have to refresh for shade search (push updates to save data to browser)
	- item search shows irrelevant items as not gotten
	- taking elevator/etc. doesn't mark transition as visited

- routing 2.0
	- get stag working right
	- options
		- benchwarp (off, discovered, all (spoilers))
		- dream warp
		- avoid room list?
	- text description of calculated route
		- push to in-game HUD
			- option to show/hide/where?
	- fix path rendering (animated glow) when there's multiple paths between two rooms (e.g. Deepnest_01b and Deepnest_02 no room rando)
	- view layout that linearizes your selected route

- data issues:
	- split room door ids on Hive_01 are wrong
	- needs to know what side has bench Hive_01, Ruins1_18
	- Ruins2_03 doens't show the grub? Or, it's on the wrong side?
	- Crossroads_01 "has a bench"

- Item viewing
	- show all items near mouse, in some cases v close or on top of each other
		- also, shops
	- test item view set to "relevant"
		- do irrelevant items still get recorded?
	- do something with the flickering when hovering over a room near the bottom of the screen?


- look into framerate
	- nn Firefox is faster than Chromium, item icons+filter and cross-island links make it worse
	- either ignore it or three.js, probably

- just show irrelevant items as irrelevant, never mind if you got it or not
	- own icon, can see if you select the view option

- names: "Mimic Room", Midwife
- add benches in trams...somehow?
- show if room has bench in room hover or give bench a more visible icon

- unmatched transitions?

- select shade room on death (if no selection)

- collapsible settings menus

- use randomizer's logic when planning routes


- zoom at least x amount when framing a room
- arrow keys+enter for search box

- icons for rooms
- mark shade room
	- PlayerData.instance.shadeScene
- color door we used to enter
- color recently taken transitions/rooms
- stronger relative positions next to user's room
- things that aren't "close" to our current room shouldn't appear close visually

- search rooms by icon

- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- Room position stability:
	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger relative positions on "many connection" rooms
	- stronger/more distant repulsion to things we aren't graph close to
	- stay close to src room if dead end
	- align with doors instead of centers

- metadata
	- missed item flag/icon
	- times visited room?
	- maybe only after you have map for the area?

- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: transport (elevators, stations, tram, dram connection), benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected
	- shade
	- dream warp

- Spoilers: give hint
	- See: JSON.parse(data.saveData.PolymorphicModData.RandomizerMod).StringValues._orderedLocations
	- next in progression or specific item, save given hints to a log

- Button to select a nearby room with unvisited transition

- travel history?


- pathfind to nearest mark of given type

- based on route, could show an in-game arrow pointing to the target transition in question

- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- record what an item is if we get near it but don't collect it? e.g. essence trees?
	- replace the rotated square with a letter or icon once you know (maybe hotload the .pngs from the Randomizer mod)

- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- maybe show where you are and your target is, if offscreen (little this-a-way arrows)

- goals/stats
	- collapsible box
	- Stats summary
		- dreamer status
		- pantheon/boss status summary
		- # of mask shards, grimm flames, grubs, essencecharm notch, ore, vessel fragments, charms, stags
		- geo and geo in relics (and geo spend?)
		- key abilities (focus, nail, dash, spells, etc)
		- "randomizer percent" (num checks/cleared checks)
	- checkboxes for common goals: any%, grubs, pantheon, 112%, moth evaportaion
	- show status toward each goal (e.g. 5/46 grubs, 2/3 dreamers, boss count and which you do/don't have)
	- "give hint" button skips things that aren't in your goals
	- show rando seed (and settings?)


- "balance" section
	- options:
		- only show completion stats with world sense
		- enable/disable room routing (off/auto/on, auto enables for room rando)
		- In-game maps reveal info
			- Show grub locations when you have the collector's map (or unveil item data)
			- Area maps: show all rooms for area, and transitions between rooms that we have maps for)
				- or maybe just reveal 40% of nearby rooms if room rando (Cornifer's maps don't start complete)
			- bonus: show where you are in a room when you have wayward compass equipped
		- grub map reveals grub items
		- Jiji hint egg gives real hints
		- Wayward compass shows where in a room you are on the map

- randomizer area vs Cornifer area

- click a door to jump to linked room
- disable long connect lines when things get slow?

Wishes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


- User feedback:
	- old/handled
		- xx hit the new save file bug
		- xx forgot dependency for websockets
		- xx found it to kill game performance on another monitor (likely multi-GPU buffer copy)
		- xx connections hard to see with long room names in the way (and maybe make room connections have dark "inside" inside the broader white outline)
		- xx when selecting a room, ability to zoom to it, or message that you haven't seen it
		- xx "it's lagging my computer" "this is pretty awful" - enough so I can see the framerate drop at 2x speed...
		- xx Confusion from elevators not being linked
		- zz somehow map stopped recording new transitions? Might be because they were reloading the map and the save data is stale bug.
		- xx room search:
			- only show visible rooms in dropdown (but maybe we just make it easy to see in selection)
			- name search

	- make dragged rooms stay where dragged a lot better
	- color transitions based on logic (if it can be taken with the current loadout)
	- performance issues when rendering in cluster layout (perhaps push cluster motion (and DOM update plans?) to web workers)
	- map wiggling bug
	- make it easier to find yourself "where am I?"
	- probably should make hub & distance the default view
	- show benches w/Benchwap mod names
	- room <-> bench routing
	- add room icons/annotation

	- hard to see bench, show if has bench in room hover
	- support for HK 1.5 + Randomizer 4?
	- unmatched transitions?
	- rooms start far apart

	- use better map icons (Cornifer icons)
	- assorted room metadata feedback
